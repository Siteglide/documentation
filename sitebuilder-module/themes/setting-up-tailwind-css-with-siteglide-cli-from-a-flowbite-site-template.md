# ðŸ“‹ Steps to Set Up Tailwind CSS with Siteglide CLI - from a Flowbite Site Template

### Before You Start <a href="#before-you-start" id="before-you-start"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This Article is very similar to [setting-up-tailwind-css-with-siteglide-cli-from-scratch.md](setting-up-tailwind-css-with-siteglide-cli-from-scratch.md "mention") but by using a Flowbite Site Template as a starting point, we are able to skip several steps, making this article a better place to start for beginners.

* Check [Choosing a Build Method](tailwind-css-themes-choosing-a-build-method.md) first to choose which option suits you best, though we strongly recommend the CLI method described in this article.

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to build a Tailwind CSS file allows you to:

* Use the latest versions of TailwindCSS and its various 1st and 3rd party plugins.
* Get the best performance front-end as Tailwind can scan your entire codebase to carry out "tree-shaking" to only include utility classes you actually need
* Faster development performance as you can rebuild your CSS faster, and therefore build things faster

Each time you start working on a new project, you will need to follow these steps, however, the setup time is worth it as it will give you a much smoother experience going forward.

## Step 1) Create a Site from any Flowbite Site Template <a href="#quick-start" id="quick-start"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use an existing Site you created from a Site Template previously, but it may not contain all of the files you need if it is older. If you get stuck, try a new Site Template creation and copy across the files you are missing.
{% endhint %}

In the Siteglide Portal, choose Marketplace in the menu and filter by the Category "Template":

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this step-by-step article, we'll use the Flowbite eCommerce Site Template, but you can use any Template which uses Tailwind CSS in its [SiteBuilder Theme](./).

Click the card to open up the modal:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Fill out the settings and click the button to start the Site Create Process.

This will take a while and you'll get an email when it finishes. You should have time to make a cup of tea and return in a few minutes to move on to Step 2.

## Step 2)  Set up Project Folder in a Code Editor and Connect it with your Siteglide Site Using Siteglide CLI

You will need to install Siteglide CLI- if you haven't or are not sure if you have, head here first:

{% content-ref url="../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md" %}
[getting-started-with-cli.md](../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Next you'll need to follow the steps to create a project folder for your new Site and setup Siteglide CLI for this new Site:

{% content-ref url="../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md" %}
[steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md](../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you've pulled the Codebase for the new Site down into your project folder, continue to the next step.

## Step 3) Move the package.json Files to the Project Folder Root

We'll be using npm (Node Package Manager) to install the software and settings we need to run Tailwind on your machine. This is the same tool you will have used to install the Siteglide-CLI.

We've built files in the Site Template which contain the instructions npm needs to set you up automatically.

Find the files in the folder:

```
â””â”€â”€â”€marketplace_builder
    â””â”€â”€â”€assets
        â””â”€â”€â”€modules
            â””â”€â”€â”€module_86
                â””â”€â”€â”€src
                    â”‚   readme.md
                    â”‚   tailwind.config.js
                    â”‚   tailwind.css
                    â””â”€â”€â”€open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time
                        â”œâ”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_root_project_folder
                        â”‚   package-lock.json
                        â”‚   package.json
                        â””â”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder
                            tailwind.config.js
                            tailwind.css
```

And **copy and paste** these two files `package.json` and `package-lock.json` into the root project folder (next to- but not inside - marketplace\_builder).

<pre><code>â”‚   package-lock.json
â”‚   package.json
â””â”€â”€â”€marketplace_builder
    â””â”€â”€â”€assets
        â””â”€â”€â”€modules
            â””â”€â”€â”€module_86
                â””â”€â”€â”€src
                    â”‚   readme.md
                    â”‚   tailwind.config.js
                    â”‚   tailwind.css
                    â””â”€â”€â”€open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time
                        â”œâ”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_root_project_folder
                        â”‚   package-lock.json
<strong>                        â”‚   package.json
</strong>                        â””â”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder
                            tailwind.config.js
                            tailwind.css
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
Because you are working from a Site Template, you don't need to copy the tailwind-config.js or the tailwind.css files. That's already done!
{% endhint %}

### Step 4) Use NPM to Automatically Install Dependencies

Using your integrated terminal from step 2, which is already open in your project directory, run the command:

```
npm i
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You may be given some warnings and information by npm at this stage. For the sake of this tutorial most are safe to ignore for now and come back to later.
{% endhint %}

## Step 5) Run Commands to Build your tailwind.min.css File and Sync it

Split your terminal in two. We'll need one window to build our Tailwind CSS and a second one to sync our changes to the Site:\\

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Use this command to build your Tailwind's CSS (we'll look at this in more detail in a minute):

```
npm run tailwind
```

In the other terminal window, use this command to sync changes to the Site with Siteglide-CLI (replace \<env> with your environment name from step 2):

```
siteglide-cli sync <env>
```

Both commands will keep running indefinately and will watch your files for changes. Every time you change a Liquid file the Tailwind will re-compile the CSS if it needs to!

You can now start building your Site using Tailwind CSS!
