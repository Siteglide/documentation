# ðŸ“‹ Steps to Set Up Tailwind CSS with Siteglide CLI on Any Site with SiteBuilder Installed

## Before You Start <a href="#before-you-start" id="before-you-start"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This Article is very similar to [setting-up-tailwind-css-with-siteglide-cli-from-a-flowbite-site-template.md](setting-up-tailwind-css-with-siteglide-cli-from-a-flowbite-site-template.md "mention") but in this article, it doesn't matter how or when you created your Site. If you install the SiteBuilder Module with any version since 4.11.2, these steps will work.
{% endhint %}

* Check [Choosing a Build Method](https://www.sitegurus.io/documentation/sitebuilder/libraries\_and\_frameworks/libraries\_using\_tailwind\_css\_choosing\_a\_build\_method) first to choose which option suits you best.
* This Article assumes you have already created and chsoen a Siteglide Site to work on

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to build a Tailwind CSS file allows you to:

* Use the latest versions of TailwindCSS and its various 1st and 3rd party plugins.
* Get the best performance front-end as Tailwind can scan your entire codebase to carry out "tree-shaking" to only include utility classes you actually need
* Faster development performance as you can rebuild your CSS faster, and therefore build things faster

Each time you start working on a new project, you will need to follow these steps, however, the setup time is worth it as it will give you a much smoother experience going forward.

## Step 1) Install the SiteBuilder Module <a href="#quick-start" id="quick-start"></a>

Check if you have already installed the SiteBuilder Module on your site. The version should be at least 4.11.2

The SiteBuilder Module comes with the Free Flowbite Theme automatically.&#x20;

If the download appears to have crashed, try refreshing the page and trying again - it is a large package of files.

## Step 2) Create a Flowbite Site Template

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have already created a Flowbite Page Template using SiteBuilder, you can skip this step.
{% endhint %}

In the Siteglide Admin, under modules in the menu, enter the SiteBuilder Module.\
\
Find Page Templates in the tabs:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the popup, choose:

* A name e.g. "Main"
* Default Page Template - optional
* the Flowbite Theme (other SiteBuilder Themes will be available to download from Marketplace)
* Optionally, add a Menu, but this is not neccesary for this tutorial

This template starts with a default Tailwind CSS file which allows most layouts to work out of the box, but if you want to start changing things, you'll need to follow the rest of these setup steps!

## Step 3) Check Your SiteBuilder Tailwind Settings are Set to CLI Build

Older versions of SiteBuilder would have defaulted to use the JIT option as a default. Make sure it's set to CLI!

## Step 4) Set up Project Folder in a Code Editor and Connect it with your Siteglide Site Using Siteglide CLI

You will need to install Siteglide CLI- if you haven't or are not sure if you have, head here first:

{% content-ref url="../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md" %}
[getting-started-with-cli.md](../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Next you'll need to follow the steps to create a project folder for your new Site and setup Siteglide CLI for this new Site:

{% content-ref url="../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md" %}
[steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md](../../command-line-interface-cli/get-started-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you've pulled the Codebase for the new Site down into your project folder, continue to the next step.

## Step 5) Move the Tailwind Files to the Correct Folders

We'll be using npm (Node Package Manager) to install the software and settings we need to run Tailwind on your machine. This is the same tool you will have used to install the Siteglide-CLI.

We've built files in the Site Template which contain the instructions npm needs to set you up automatically.

Find the files in the folder:

```
â””â”€â”€â”€marketplace_builder
    â””â”€â”€â”€assets
        â””â”€â”€â”€modules
            â””â”€â”€â”€module_86
                â””â”€â”€â”€src
                    â”‚   readme.md
                    â””â”€â”€â”€open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time
                        â”œâ”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_root_project_folder
                        â”‚   package-lock.json
                        â”‚   package.json
                        â””â”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder
                            tailwind.config.js
                            tailwind.css
```

And **copy and paste** these two files `package.json` and `package-lock.json` into the root project folder (next to- but not inside - marketplace\_builder).

<pre><code>â”‚   package-lock.json
â”‚   package.json
â””â”€â”€â”€marketplace_builder
    â””â”€â”€â”€assets
        â””â”€â”€â”€modules
            â””â”€â”€â”€module_86
                â””â”€â”€â”€src
                    â”‚   readme.md
                    â””â”€â”€â”€open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time
                        â”œâ”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_root_project_folder
                        â”‚   package-lock.json
<strong>                        â”‚   package.json
</strong>                        â””â”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder
                            tailwind.config.js
                            tailwind.css
</code></pre>

Next, move the `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` files from the `copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder` folder to the `marketplace_builder/assets/modules/module_86/src folder`:

<pre><code>â”‚   package-lock.json
â”‚   package.json
â””â”€â”€â”€marketplace_builder
    â””â”€â”€â”€assets
        â””â”€â”€â”€modules
            â””â”€â”€â”€module_86
                â””â”€â”€â”€src
                    â”‚   readme.md
                    â”‚   tailwind.config.js
                    â”‚   tailwind.css
                    â””â”€â”€â”€open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time
                        â”œâ”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_root_project_folder
                        â”‚   package-lock.json
<strong>                        â”‚   package.json
</strong>                        â””â”€â”€â”€copy_and_paste_my_files_into_the_src_folder
                            tailwind.config.js
                            tailwind.css
</code></pre>

## Step 6) Use NPM to Automatically Install Dependencies

Using your integrated terminal from step 2, which is already open in your project directory, run the command:

```
npm i
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You may be given some warnings and information by npm at this stage. For the sake of this tutorial most are safe to ignore for now and come back to later.
{% endhint %}

## Step 7) Run Commands to Build your tailwind.min.css File and Sync it

Split your terminal in two. We'll need one window to build our Tailwind CSS and a second one to sync our changes to the Site:\\

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Use this command to build your Tailwind's CSS (we'll look at this in more detail in a minute):

```
npm run tailwind
```

In the other terminal window, use this command to sync changes to the Site with Siteglide-CLI (replace \<env> with your environment name from step 2):

```
siteglide-cli sync <env>
```

Both commands will keep running indefinately and will watch your files for changes. Every time you change a Liquid file the Tailwind will re-compile the CSS if it needs to!

You can now start building your Site using Tailwind CSS!
