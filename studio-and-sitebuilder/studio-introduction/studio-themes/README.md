# Studio Themes

Studio Themes determine the look and feel of a website. Themes group together all the styling meaning you can run different websites side by side. Studio Templates require a Theme and Pages require a Template so effectively every page runs from a Theme.

Start by installing a Theme: [install-a-studio-theme.md](install-a-studio-theme.md "mention") or copying a Studio Site template: [setup.md](../setup.md "mention")

If you're looking to create Themes you'll need our Studio Theme Publisher: [studio-theme-publisher.md](studio-theme-publisher.md "mention")
