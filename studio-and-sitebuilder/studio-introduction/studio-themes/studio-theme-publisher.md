# Studio Theme Publisher

If you're wanting to create Themes you can reuse across sites or even offer/sell to the Siteglide community you will need to use the Studio Theme Publisher in Portal.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you wish to let people start from a pre-installed Site Template you still need to also add this to the Siteglide Marketplace as normal: [site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md](../../../developer-tools/building-for-marketplace/site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

Navigate to 'Studio Theme Publisher' in Portal (you will likely not see any Themes):

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Studio-Theme-Publisher.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Create a Marketplace Theme

Click 'Create New Theme' and fill in the details:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Studio-Theme-Publisher-Details.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Select the Site where you've created the Theme and Sections, these will then be available on other sites that have this Theme installed.

It's important to set the correct Default Page Template and the name of the Theme must match the Theme name in the source Site (shown in CMS > Studio Themes).
