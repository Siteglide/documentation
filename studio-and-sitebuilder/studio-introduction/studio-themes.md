# Studio Themes

Studio Themes determine the look and feel of a website. Themes group together all the styling meaning you can run different websites side by side. Studio Templates require a Theme and Pages require a Template so effectively every page runs from a Theme.

You can create and manage Themes in Studio, simply navigate to CMS > Studio Themes.

The 'Styling' tab is where you manage global styles such as Colours and Fonts.

The Head and Scripts tabs allow you to add HTML to the head and closing body areas of all Pages and Templates that use that Theme.

The Custom CSS tab allows you to define any specifc CSS to override the core framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap etc).

Finaly the Tailwind Variables tab lets you override and define specific Tailwind Variables (this is only relevant when using Tailwind as your framework).
