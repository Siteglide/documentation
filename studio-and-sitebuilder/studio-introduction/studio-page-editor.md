# Studio Page Editor

Studio makes editing pages extremely easy by separating content from code. You simply navigate the page visually in the left-hand preview, click the section you'd like to edit and then edit the content on the right.

There are a few different types of content and ways to edit them:

1. Fields: Individual elements that appear on the page, simply click and edit.
2. Components: Dynamic elements such as buttons allowing you to add additional items.
3. Lists: Dynamic repeatable content, very powerful for managing repeating content types (e.g. Team Members or FAQs).
4. Settings: Some sections are setup so that you can customise additional things (e.g. swap text and image left to right).
