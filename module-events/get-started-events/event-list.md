We'll explain how to output a List View of Events and link you to the docs on advanced Filtering and Navigation

# Introduction

The Events Module comes with a wide range of options for your List View. You can output Events as:

*   A standard List

*   [A Map](https://developers.siteglide.com/the-map-list-layout)

*   [A Calendar](https://help.siteglide.com/article/147-events-module-the-calendar-list-layout)

You can also use our [Navigation options](https://developers.siteglide.com/navigation-introduction) with any of these views.

# Outputting a List View

You can output a List View in any Liquid File - that means:

*   Pages

*   Templates

*   Headers

*   Footers

*   Layouts

*   Code Snippets 

*   Content Sections

Basic List views will also work in workflow and auto-responder emails, but be aware that any features which depend on JavaScript or URL parameters will not be supported in this context- that includes the Map and Calendar Layouts.

Use the following Liquid Syntax to output an Events List view:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{%- include 'module'
    id: '12'
    layout: 'design_system/1/list'
    per_page: '2000'
    show_pagination: 'false'
    sub_model: 'true' 
-%}
{% endraw %}
```
