### 1.0.1 - 12th July 2020

* Added easier support for multiple Sliders of the same Layout to be added to the same Page using the Liquid parameter: `uniq_slider_id` to provide each instance of a Layout with a unique ID that will be selected by the JavaScript. - [Docs](https://developers.siteglide.com/slider)
* Added logic to the Slider Layouts to make sure the Layout contents are not loaded when no Slider Items are available in the Module (after filters are applied). This fixes a bug where if there were no available items, the JavaScript would experience an unhandled error.
