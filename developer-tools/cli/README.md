# CLI

## Comfortable with code?&#x20;

We recommend using our CLI (Command Line Interface).

{% content-ref url="quickstart.md" %}
[quickstart.md](quickstart.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## New to Command Line Interfaces?

You can go further, faster with CLI but it's not for everyone, we recommend reading the following article before deciding:

{% content-ref url="get-started-with-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md" %}
[getting-started-with-cli.md](get-started-with-cli/getting-started-with-cli.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Already installed CLI?

Useful links once CLI is installed:

{% content-ref url="get-started-with-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md" %}
[steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md](get-started-with-cli/steps-to-set-up-siteglide-cli-on-a-specific-site.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="troubleshooting.md" %}
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="cli-reference/siteglide-cli-reference.md" %}
[siteglide-cli-reference.md](cli-reference/siteglide-cli-reference.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
