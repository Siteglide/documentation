***

### 1.7.0 - 6th November 2020

**Features**

Liquid Evaluator - Alongside our GraphiQL editor, we now have a new Liquid Evaluator tool. This will let you quickly test Liquid from the CLI, without having to create and save a page in Siteglide Admin. To use this new tool, we have moved it and GraphiQL to `siteglide-cli gui <env>` command. The `siteglide-cli graphql <env>` command will continue to work, but is now deprecated and will be removed in a future update

Sync

* Sync now watches for and syncs .map files which are commonly used alongside minified CSS or JS files.

Export

* Export has a new optional flag of `--csv`, this will export the data files as a zip of multiple CSV files instead of JSON.

Migrate:

* Migrate will now no longer automatically deploy the site when it has finished. This gives you time to remove and folders/pages that you may not want to be migrated. You can then use the `siteglide-cli deploy <env> -w` command as normal to deploy the site. You can use automatic deploy within a migration by including the `-a` flag

**Bug Fixes**

Deploy

* Fixed an issue where the homepage would not update properly when the site is deployed

Pull

* Pull will now automatically stop and exit if it fails

Migrate

* Fixed an issue where migrate would not run under certain environments
