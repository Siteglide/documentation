# About Building Modules

Building Modules could be the perfect way to keep your workflow "DRY" (don't repeat yourself)! If you find a common requirement on more than one site, and no-one is currently offering a solution, or you think you can build a better one, building Modules might be for you.

## What Skills do I Need?

For some types of Module, anyone can have a go, for example building a Site Template could be done by a Designer with a little bit of HTML and CSS knowledge:

{% content-ref url="site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md" %}
[site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md](site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For other kinds of Module, we recommend getting hold of a developer. If you don't have one, check out Sitegurus who can provide this service.

## Getting Started

## To Publish or Not?

One way to start building Modules is to build them as an internal tool for your Agency. This doesn't require any approval from Siteglide.

Or, you can publish your Module on the marketplace. This requires Siteglide approval so we can check the module is transparent about the kind of code it runs. You can either:

* Make the Module Open-Source
  * You can either all Siteglide users access, or require them to contact you before you decide whether to give their organisation access
  * You can optionally allow others to contribute to your Github repository
* or Accept Payments
