#### How do I add an Automation?

In the Table Builder view click the 'Automations' tab.From here you select the Trigger and Action to use, and then enter the relevant details for that Action.

In all Automations, you can access the data of an item using both `{{data}}` or `{{form}}` in your code editor.

Once you save your changes, the Automation will then be in place. For example, next time someone creates a WebApp item, your selected Action will be performed.

Note: From this view you can also edit or delete any existing Automations.
