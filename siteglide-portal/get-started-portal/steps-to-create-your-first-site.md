## Step 2: Choose Site Creation Method

You have the option to create a new site from scratch or use a template. If you're new to SiteGlide or less technical, it's recommended to start with a template.

```html
Create New Site > Create from Template
```

## Step 3: Select a Template

This will take you to the marketplace where you can select a category of templates. You can choose between all of our FlowByte layout templates or a couple of bootstrap options. It's recommended to use FlowByte, especially if you're familiar with Tailwind.

```html
Create from Template > Select Category > Choose Template
```

## Step 4: Choose the Appropriate Template

We recommend starting with the landing page or the marketing site. Choose the marketing site if you want to see more SiteGlide functionality or the landing page if you want a simpler layout.

```html
Choose Template > Landing Page/Marketing Site
```

## Step 5: Create the Site

Finally, give your site a name and click 'Create Site'.

```html
Enter Site Name > Create Site
```

And that's it! You've successfully created a new site using SiteGlide's admin area.
