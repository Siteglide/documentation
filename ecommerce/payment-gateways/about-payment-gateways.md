# ðŸ’¡ About Payment Gateways

After you've installed the eCommerce Module on a Site, setting up a Payment Gateway is the next step!

## What is a Payment Gateway?

Siteglide never stores your customers' full card details. Instead we integrate with globally recognised and trusted payment gateways to store that information and process payments on your behalf e.g. Stripe or PayPal.

Stay in this section for information about how to set up, different configuration advice for different gateways and how to run multiple gateways on a site and let customers choose between them.

## Compatibility

At the current time, some Payment Gateways allow more access to Siteglide features than others.

**The Stripe Payment Gateway is recommended as fully compatible with all Siteglide Features.**

PayPal is compatible with Basic Payment Forms and Cart + Checkout

Authorize.net is only compatible with Basic Payment Forms
