# ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Product Layouts based on Categories

Wondering how to adjust the Product Detail Page based on Category?

## Answer:

As a User navigates to your Product Detail Page, Siteglide will load the Detail View you have specified in your eCommerce Settings. However, it is perfectly possible to customise this based on [Categories](../../../../categories/about-categories.md), using Liquid logic! You can read more about using Categories on the Layout of the WebApp or Module Item they belong to [here](../../../../categories/go-further-categories/filtering-webapps-and-modules-by-categories.md).

In this example, you'd need to know the ID of a category you want to display; this can be found in Admin when you select a category. E.g. let's say we want to display something special when something has the category "Featured" and you know it has an ID of "111111":

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% assign featured_id = "111111" %}
{% for category_id in this.category_array -%}
  {% if category_id == featured_id %}
    <!-- Add Featured Content Here -->
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```
