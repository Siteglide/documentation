This article for developers helps you get more out of Secure Zones, as you can output basic information about the Current User dynamically.

# Prerequisites

*   You have installed the Secure Zones Module

*   You have added a User Sign Up Form

*   A User has logged in

# The current\_user Object

When a User signs up or logs into your site, we store basic information about that user. You can use this to make the page respond uniquely to that user.&#x20;

Outputting the following liquid on the page shows the full range of fields available:`{{context.current_user | json}}
`
You can traverse through the fields in the object and output them with dot notation. E.g. `{{context.current_user.first_name}}
`
This will output the current user's first name, so you can say hello. 

You could also use an if statement to run logic using this. E.g. If I want to say hello to all users with a siteglide email address:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% if context.current_user.email contains "@siteglide.com" %}
  <p>Hello Siteglider!</p>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```
