# Automatic Site Maps

You can output a list of pages using the following include:

```liquid
{% include 'sitemap', layout: 'xml', types: 'pages' -%}
```

*   layout - xml or html - These are set layouts for each type. html will output in

    * format.
    * types - Choose what types of content you want to show, by submitting a comma separated list from these options: pages,webapps,modules,products

    The sitemap will only show items that are enabled, have a detail view, have a slug and are within their released/expired timeframe.

    For best results, use this include on your sitemap.xml System Page (with the xml layout) or your own custom Page (with the html layout)
