# Quickstart: Reports

The Reporting tool allows you to build dynamic reports related to CRM usage and Form Cases. You can choose which Fields to include and filter the results. Once a Report is Saved you can go back to this at any time and see the results with live data.

If you've not created any reports this area will be blank:

## Step 1: Create a Report

When creating a new Report simply give it a name, decide if you're querying the CRM Users Database or the Cases Database and then pick the Fields you want to include:
