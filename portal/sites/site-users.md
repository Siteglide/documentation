You can only invite existing Siteglide users to Sites, you might be working with an external Siteglide Expert, you would give them access to this Site here.

## Want to invite new Users to your account?

If you're looking to invite your own team to manage the site you would need to add them to your Account:

{% content-ref url="../users-and-user-roles/invite-and-manage-users.md" %}
[invite-and-manage-users.md](../users-and-user-roles/invite-and-manage-users.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
