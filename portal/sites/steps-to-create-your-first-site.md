# ðŸ“‹ Create a Site

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new site using Siteglide's admin area.

## Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Once you're logged into the portal, you'll find yourself on the dashboard.

If you don't see a 'Create a Website' button (as per 2nd screenshot) please contact us via Live Chat to prove you're human and we'll get you setup!

Once you're account is approved you should see the Create a Website button:

If you already have 1 or more site you'll see options to create a site, manage existing sites, or manage your company:

</div>

## Step 2: Choose Site Creation Method

You have the option to create a new site from scratch or use a Template. If you're new to Siteglide or less technical, it's recommended to start with a template.

## Step 3: Select a Template

This will take you to the Marketplace where you can select a category of templates. You can choose between all of our Flowbite layout templates or a couple of Bootstrap 5 options. It's recommended to use Flowbite, especially if you're familiar with Tailwind.

## Step 4: Choose the Appropriate Template

We recommend starting with the Landing Page or the Marketing Site Template. Choose the Marketing Site if you want to see more Siteglide functionality or the Landing Page if you'd rather just learn the basics first.

## Step 5: Create the Site

Finally, give your site a name and click 'Create Site'.

And that's it! You've successfully created a new site, you will need to wait for it to be ready to use. You will receive an email when it's done but can also find it under the Sites area:

If you're a developer you'll likely want to be able to easily edit the Tailwind CSS via our CLI:

{% content-ref url="../../sitebuilder/setup-sitebuilder/set-up-tailwind-css.md" %}
[set-up-tailwind-css.md](../../sitebuilder/setup-sitebuilder/set-up-tailwind-css.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
