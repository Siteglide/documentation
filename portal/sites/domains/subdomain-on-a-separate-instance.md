# ðŸ’» Subdomain on a separate instance

{% hint style="info" %}
This example is only applicable where your top level domain is fully delegated to Siteglide. If using External DNS Step 2 would not be done in Siteglide but instead wherever your DNS is managed.
{% endhint %}

You might want to have www.example.com on one Siteglide instance and app.example.com (or any other subdomain) on another Siteglide instance.

1. First add your subdomain to the second instance as a new domain:

1. Then go to the DNS records of your fully delegated domain and create a CNAME as follows:

| Name | Type  | Value       |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| app  | CNAME | example.com |

This will use the SSL certificate from the top level domain and resolve correctly to the new instance.
