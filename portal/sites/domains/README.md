# üåç Domains

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only manage custom domains on a Live Production Site on Siteglide, if you see the Go Live tab and not the Domains tab then the site is not Live. Please follow the Go Live steps: [go-live.md](../go-live.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Want to Add a New Domain?

You can either Fully Delegate your DNS to Siteglide or manage it externally:

{% content-ref url="add-a-fully-delegated-domain.md" %}
[add-a-fully-delegated-domain.md](add-a-fully-delegated-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="add-an-external-domain.md" %}
[add-an-external-domain.md](add-an-external-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
