# ðŸ“‹ User Roles

User Roles determine what users can see and do within Siteglide. Account owners have granular control over this and can set others as Admins or limit what they can do.

## Manage Roles

You can then change or add additional Roles for that User:

## Create a New User Role

To create a New Role just give it a name and select the granular controls they have access to:

You can also copy permissions from an existing role to save time:

## See Roles Assigned to Users

You can see what Role a User has by clicking the Roles tab on a User:
