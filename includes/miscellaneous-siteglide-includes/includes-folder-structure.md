# ðŸŒ³ Includes File Structure

## File Structure

Files in the includes folder must be named with a unique number which matches the ID in their Yaml.&#x20;

See the documentation for specific features to see where their layouts sit within the layouts folder. Code Editor in the Siteglide Admin normally starts its folder structure view at "layouts".&#x20;

```plaintext
marketplace_builder/
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ partials/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ includes/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ code_snippets/
â”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1.liquid
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content_sections/
â”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1.liquid
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ headers/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ footers/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ layouts
```

When using the "include" tag to include a partial Liquid file, the path should always start relative to the partials folder and it should not include the .liquid extension, as this is assumed.&#x20;
