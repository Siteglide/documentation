# ðŸ“‹ Installing Layouts

### Installing Static Layouts <a href="#installing-static-layouts" id="installing-static-layouts"></a>

Static Layouts are sections of pre-built HTML code that you can add to your pages in the Siteglide Admin. They do not generally contain any Liquid templating, so won't pull in any dynamic content from the server or CMS. Instead, you can use Siteglide's Studio tab to edit their content directly in the page.

### Modules and Dynamic Layouts <a href="#modules-and-dynamic-layouts" id="modules-and-dynamic-layouts"></a>

Once you've installed a Page Template, check out the [Dynamic Module Layouts](https://www.sitegurus.io/documentation/sitebuilder/modules\_and\_more/dynamic\_module\_layouts) to see what kind of dynamic content is available for this Theme.
