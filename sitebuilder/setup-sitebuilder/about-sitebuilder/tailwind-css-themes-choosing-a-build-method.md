# üèóÔ∏è Tailwind CSS Themes - Choosing a Build Method

![Choosing a Build Method](https://res.cloudinary.com/sitegurus/image/upload/v1656591688/modules/module\_86/admin/library\_thumbs/tailwindui.jpg)

Tailwind CSS is accelerating in popularity with its bold new approach to writing CSS for the web. You‚Äôre probably wondering how you can harness this new framework on a Siteglide site?

Tailwind‚Äôs approach to performance means it provides a huge range of utility classes, but to prevent it from slowing down your site with classes you don‚Äôt need, it builds a smaller CSS file containing just the subset of classes that you‚Äôre actually using in your project.

There are a few alternatives to consider when it comes to generating a Tailwind CSS file for your Siteglide site:

1. A Command Line Interface (CLI) Compilation on your machine (recommended)
2. Preview Mode
3. Just In Time (JIT) Compilation in the Browser (deprecated)

### Which one is right for me? <a href="#which-one-is-right-for-me" id="which-one-is-right-for-me"></a>

That depends!

Both methods have their advantages, which we'll look at here, but it also depends on the preference of the developer and the type of project you're working on.

You can use most features from version 2.0 of Tailwind.

In the end, it depends on your preference and the way your clients wish to use your site.&#x20;

If you use the Siteglide-CLI already to take advantage of modern code editing tools, you'll be right at home with our recommended method: Tailwind CLI.

{% content-ref url="../set-up-tailwind-css.md" %}
[set-up-tailwind-css.md](../set-up-tailwind-css.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../editing-tailwind-css.md" %}
[editing-tailwind-css.md](../editing-tailwind-css.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you, or your client, wish to build and preview your Pages in the Siteglide Admin without frequent use of the Siteglide CLI, Preview Mode may be for you. We still recommend using the Tailwind CLI now and again to set up your brand variables and to set them consistently across all of your pages at once, but this does not need to be done every time you make a change in Admin, allowing for a potentially smoother experience for clients and development.&#x20;
