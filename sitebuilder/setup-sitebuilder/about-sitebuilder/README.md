# About

## What is SiteBuilder?

SiteBuilder is a tool to help you build better websites, faster.&#x20;

An end-to-end web design and development ecosystem to rapidly launch websites, portals, applications and much more.

## Core Concepts

SiteBuilder offers 2 main things:

1. **Layouts:** Build out sites with ready-made, best-practice sections in just a few clicks
2. **Builder:** SiteBuilder will do the heavy lifting in Siteglide for you from a simple, intuitive UI

Sitebuilder does **NOT** limit what you can build, it's simply a starting point for rapid development that can then be completely customised.

## How Does It Work? <a href="#how-does-it-work" id="how-does-it-work"></a>

Some code repositories require you to copy and paste code from the example into your site, but this can be fiddly if the code needs to go into lots of different folders and files.

SiteBuilder does the hard work for you and is plug & play!

When you choose one of our Layouts, all you have to do is give it a name and we'll create the required file structure automatically. The layout will be ready to use in your Siteglide site and, where supported, available in Toolbox!
