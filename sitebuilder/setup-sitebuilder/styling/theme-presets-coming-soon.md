# üèóÔ∏è Theme Presets - Coming Soon

Our first release of Theme Skins only supports Tailwind-based Themes, since we are able to leverage the powerful presets feature provided by Tailwind.&#x20;

## About Presets

Theme Presets are a Way to change a Theme's CSS variables, like colour and font, giving your site an interesting new look without needing to make big changes to HTML or CSS classes. They should be compatible with all our existing Flowbite layouts.\
\
They are useful for:

* Create new sites using the SiteBuilder layouts, and give them a distinctive look from step one.
* Take an existing site and try it out with different presets to help you or your client visualise different design choices with the real content.&#x20;

## Getting Started - Coming Soon

The easiest way to get started with a Theme Preset is to install a site from one of our Site Templates which comes with a specific preset already set up. This will have the preset set up and ready to go, and the preset's variables will also be ready in the Page Template's preview mode.&#x20;

## Usage - Via SiteBuilder Settings

1. Open the Modules / SiteBuilder Module

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've not already, create a Page Template with a Flowbite Theme.
{% endhint %}

2. Navigate to the settings tab
