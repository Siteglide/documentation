# Extend SiteBuilder

SiteBuilder is now designed to be extendable. Developers can add new Themes and modules. They can also extend our core libraries (and their own) with new layouts.

#### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

Developers will need to have a good understanding of:

* Building a custom module on Siteglide
* The syntax of writing JSON objects. We use this for configuration.

#### Theme or Module? <a href="#theme-or-module" id="theme-or-module"></a>

There are two main pathways to extending SiteBuilder with content and a good starting point is to work out which one matches your needs best:

{% content-ref url="creating-sitebuilder-themes.md" %}
[creating-sitebuilder-themes.md](creating-sitebuilder-themes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="support-for-marketplace-modules.md" %}
[support-for-marketplace-modules.md](support-for-marketplace-modules.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Using Content from 3rd Parties <a href="#using-content-from-3rd-parties" id="using-content-from-3rd-parties"></a>

If you wish to add a new library to SiteBuilder which contains code published by a 3rd party, please check that you are allowed to do so under the terms of your license, for example, if the license is "open-source". If you have a license which covers your own agency's use, but does not allow you to redistribute the code as your own product, it's advisable to either:

* ask the copyright holder for permission to resell their content as a SiteBuilder-compatible module
* build the module for your agency's personal use, but keep it "private" on the Siteglide marketplace.
