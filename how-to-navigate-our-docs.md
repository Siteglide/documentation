# ðŸ’¡ How to Navigate our Docs

We've structured our docs to focus on 3 things:

1. :rocket: **Get Started:** These sections explain the fundamentals and help you use the out-of-the-box tools built into Siteglide. By following this section you should be able to build and semi-customise sites using the Siteglide Admin and CLI.&#x20;
2. :man\_mage: **Go Further:** This is where you'd find more detailed docs that help you really push the boundaries of all things web development. One of the biggest benefits of Siteglide over other platforms is you can go beyond the Siteglide feature set by tapping into the core infrastructure capabilities using GraphQL.
3. :eyes: **Reference:** Sometimes you just need to find a tag to insert a specific field/value or maybe you want to know the folder structure of a specific feature. Use our reference section to quickly find information and also troubleshoot issues.
