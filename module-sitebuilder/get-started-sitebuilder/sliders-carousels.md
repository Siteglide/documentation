# ðŸ”¹ Sliders / Carousels

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Add responsive, navigable sliders and carousels to your Site with SiteBuilder's layouts for the Siteglide Slider module.

We'll also add layouts with slider functionality to other modules, where suitable, and this document will also cover them.

### Layouts Utilising the open-source Swiper.js Library <a href="#layouts-utilising-the-opensource-swiperjs-library" id="layouts-utilising-the-opensource-swiperjs-library"></a>

Any developer can contribute layouts to SiteBuilder, so it's possible to add slider layouts using any front-end JavaScript library.

Having said that, Sitegurus' preferred library for this functionality at the current time is Swiper.js and we'll be using it for slider-like layouts on all of the Themes which we contribute to.

You can read more about how we do this, and how you can take full advantage of the available settings and effects in the [JavaScript documentation for Sliders](https://www.sitegurus.io/documentation/sitebuilder/javascript/sliders).
