# ðŸ’¡ About SiteBuilder

## SiteBuilder's Mission <a href="#sitebuilders-mission" id="sitebuilders-mission"></a>

The mission of the SiteBuilder Module is to give you easy access to the best examples of Siteglide-ready code from the Sitegurus team!

These examples include everything from small component layouts to entire sites and we'll be constantly expanding our offering.

## How Does It Work? <a href="#how-does-it-work" id="how-does-it-work"></a>

Some code repositories require you to copy and paste code from the example into your site, but this can be fiddly if the code needs to go into lots of different folders and files.

SiteBuilder does the hard work for you and is plug & play!

When you choose one of our examples, all you have to do is give it a name and we'll create the required file structure automatically. The layout will be ready to use in your Siteglide site and, where supported, available in Toolbox!&#x20;
