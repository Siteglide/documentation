# Blog & Authors

## About the Blog & Authors Module

The Blog Module makes it easy for your client to post regular updates to their site whether that be an informal blog, a company press release or a more journalistic set of articles.\
\
The Siteglide Blog has special features for:

* Archive + Date Range Filter
* A built-in datasource with its sister module, Authors. This can be used to connect a Blog Article with an Author and display information about one on the other's detail view.

As well as standard Siteglide Module features such as:

* List View
  * Search
  * Category Filter
  * Custom Field Filters
* Detail View
