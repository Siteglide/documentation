# SiteBuilder

SiteBuilder has become our recommended way of building with Siteglide given the speed and best practice approach. It has a dedicated area of the Docs:

{% content-ref url="../../studio-and-sitebuilder/setup-sitebuilder/" %}
[setup-sitebuilder](../../studio-and-sitebuilder/setup-sitebuilder/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
