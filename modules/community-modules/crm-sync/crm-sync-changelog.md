### Notes on versioning <a href="#notes-on-versioning" id="notes-on-versioning"></a>

Different versions of the module will use different paths for the main include. This means you can continue to use the older module code on existing sites, or upgrade to use the new tag. If the 3rd party tool we are integrating with stops supporting that version of their API, we cannot guarantee older versions will continue to work as before.

### Version 1.0.0 - Released 28th July 2023 <a href="#version-100-released-28th-july-2023" id="version-100-released-28th-july-2023"></a>
