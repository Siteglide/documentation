## "This" Object Fields

The "this" object can be accessed on Product detail/item.liquid, list/item.liquid and attribute layout files. It contains the properties of the current Product and contains further relevant objects e.g. Price.

The entire "this" object can be outputted on the page for reference: `{{this | json}}` The following fields are available:

## Accessing Custom Field Sets

Custom Field Set data linked to Products is available in Product detail/item.liquid, list/item.liquid and attribute layout files.

Any Custom Field Sets that have been associated with the product will be stored under: `{{this.cfs_data}}`

You can output the above liquid in the item.liquid file to see all of Custom Field Sets associated with the Product. Each of these will have the key "cfs\_1", "cfs\_2" etc. For example, a developer has created just one Custom Field Set to store information about the Guarantee on the Product. The field can be accessed via: `{{this.cfs_data.cfs_1.Guarantee}}`

See more information about Custom Field Sets [here](https://help.siteglide.com/article/207-custom-field-sets).

| Enabled        | \{{this.inventory.enabled\}}         | A "true" or "false" boolean, defaults to true.                                                                                                 |

| Inventory Type | \{{this.inventory.inventory\_type\}} | The type of Inventory. Currently, only "Global" is available.                                                                                  |
| Display Type   | \{{this.inventory.display\_type\}}   | This stores the policy on what to do when the Inventory reaches zero. Either the Product can not be ordered, or it should be hidden from view. |

## The Attributes Object

These are available once Attributes have been added against the Product in Admin and you are inside a detail/item.liquid file or an Attribute layout file.

You can access the Attributes Object via the following liquid output: `{{ this.product_attribute_options }}`

### Inside the Attribute Layout

#### Output Options for this Layout

Inside the Attribute Layout, you can access just the Options for that specific Attribute: `{{ product_attribute_options }}`

#### Output this Attribute's Name

You can also access the name of the Attribute this Layout is currently displaying: `{{this_attribute.properties.name}}`

#### Looping Over Attribute Options and Accessing Option Fields

As explained in the Attributes Layout Doc, we recommend you loop over the object and access the fields via the "option" liquid variable.

```liquid
<select name="attr1" 
        class="form-control" 
        data-attribute-control="{{product_attribute_id}}" 
        onchange="s_e_update_price()">
  {% raw %}
{% for option in product_attribute_options %}
    <option value="{{option.id}}" 
            data-attribute-price-control="{{option.price_raw}}">
            {{option.name}} this.price.currency_symbol}}{{option.price}})
            </option>
  {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
</select>
```

Assuming the above example liquid forloop has been implemented, you can access the fields in the table below. Remember the "option" liquid variable can be renamed, so if you have done this, replace "option" with the name you have given the variable. The Object contains Attribute Options and each of these contains information on the Attribute it is linked with.

| Attribute                                  | \{{ option.product\_attribute.product\_id \}} | The Unique Product ID that this Attribute is associated with. |
