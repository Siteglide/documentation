# ðŸ‘€ Orders Reference

## Orders Detail Layout

Within the Orders Detail Layout you will have access to the orders array variable. To display a list of items in the single order, you should add a Liquid loop like this:

```
{% raw %}
{% for order in orders %}
  <!-- {{order.id}} etc. -->
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

Within the loop, you can use properties of the object within the loop iteration as detailed in the table:

| Field Name     | Liquid Tag            | Description                                           |
