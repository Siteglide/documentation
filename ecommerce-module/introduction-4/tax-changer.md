## What it does


Our Tax Code Changer will allow you to output a list of all Tax Codes on your site that are linked to the current session's currency. You can then set a new Tax Code for that session.

The JS function must be sent a valid Tax Code ID. See the layout named `default` for an example of how this is achieved via a `<select />` dropdown.

## How to add the Tax Code Changer to your view


You can add a Tax Code Changer to your site using the following include:

`{%- include 'ecommerce/tax_code_changer', layout: 'default' -%}`

***

## Layouts


You can find layouts at `layouts > modules > module_14 (eCommerce) > components > tax_code_changer > your_layout_name_here`

The layout will require a `wrapper` and `item` file, which you can see in place in the layout named `default` that comes installed with the eCommerce Module.
