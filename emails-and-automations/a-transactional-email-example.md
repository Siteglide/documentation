# ðŸ”¹ A Transactional Email Example

{% hint style="info" %}
We strongly recommend that you [authorize Sendgrid](steps-to-authenticating-sendgrid-emails-on-live-sites.md) to send emails from your domain to avoid them going to spam filters, or being rejected from sending by your DMARC policy.&#x20;

Once you've read how our [introduction to Automations](about-automations.md), you're ready to start creating your own.  Siteglide Automations can send transactional Emails powered by Sendgrid. By transactional emails, we mean an email sent to, or c.c.ed to one or a few relevant people when a trigger occurs. Below is an example of an email in Automations.

This example will send an email to 'site-admin@siteglide.com' with a link to the newly created item.
