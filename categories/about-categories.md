# ðŸš€ Get Started: Categories

Categories are an excellent method for sorting and grouping content on your Site in an intuitive, hierarchical way.

Categories can be useful in a number of situations:

* &#x20;segmenting blogs and services
* displaying related services on a page due to those items being in the same category.
* Categories are also used in eCommerce to form product catalogues and groups.
* Building a menu of categories with items displayed underneath

Each Category can optionally have an automatic system detail Page enabled for it, which will be accessible at a URL which is based off the category's ancestor's in the hierarchy, followed by its own unique slug e.g. the following category structure:

* Shop
  * Clothing
    * Unisex
      * Hats

Would have the following URL for the Hats detail page:

```html
/shop/clothing/unisex/hats
```

You can optionally apply a Category Detail Layout to all of these enabled detail Pages.&#x20;
