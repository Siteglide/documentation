# ðŸš€ Quickstart: Automations

## Step 1: Where to Add the Automation

Automations can be added in various places in Siteglide including:

1. Forms
2. WebApps
3. Modules
4. eCommerce

## Step 2: Add New Automation and Select a Trigger

On the Automations tab there's a plus icon (:heavy\_plus\_sign:) on the right hand side, this will then show the Triggers dropdown list:

## Step 3: Select your Action

Once you've selected your Trigger it will show the available Actions and other information or settings available:

## Step 4: Customise the Action

In all Automations, you can access the data of an item using both `{{data}}` or `{{form}}` in your code editor.

Once you save your changes, the Automation will then be in place. For example, next time someone creates a WebApp item, your selected Action will be performed.

Note: From this view you can also edit or delete any existing Automations.
