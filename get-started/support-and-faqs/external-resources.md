### Introduction

A collection of 3rd party links that our partners find useful when developing websites.

These sites are full of useful content, but any advice and examples published by 3rd party Sites is their own. We do not recommend any particular Front End library and encourage your agency to find the front-end tools and techniques that work for you.

### platformOS Features

Siteglide is built upon platformOS, so their documentation is a fantastic resource for adding custom functionality to your Siteglide Website: [https://documentation.platformos.com/](https://documentation.platformos.com/)

### Liquid Documentation:

We also recommend the platformOS docs as the ultimate authority on using Liquid in your Siteglide Site. They include documentation on the original Liquid features and the additional features platformOS have added themselves: [https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/introduction](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/introduction)

### Working with JSON

You'll come across JSON when you are working on Migrations and commonly when working with Liquid. It's a common language for storing data-structures, so if you output `{{this}}` in a Layout- we'll show you the JSON which stores the fields you need.

Using a third party JSON tool is useful to actually take the raw data and make it easy to read. Everyone has a different favourite tool, but you can see a third party comparison here to help you get started and find one: [https://geekflare.com/json-online-tools/](https://geekflare.com/json-online-tools/)
