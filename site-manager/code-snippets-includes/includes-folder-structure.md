# Includes File Structure

## File Structure

Files in the includes folder must be named with a unique number which matches the ID in their Yaml.

See the documentation for specific features to see where their layouts sit within the layouts folder. Code Editor in the Siteglide Admin normally starts its folder structure view at "layouts".

```plaintext
marketplace_builder/
├── views/
│   └── partials/
│       ├── includes/
│       │   └── code_snippets/
│       │   │   └── 1.liquid
│       │   ├── content_sections/
│       │   │   └── 1.liquid
│       │   ├── headers/
│       │   └── footers/
│       └── layouts
```

When using the "include" tag to include a partial Liquid file, the path should always start relative to the partials folder and it should not include the .liquid extension, as this is assumed.
