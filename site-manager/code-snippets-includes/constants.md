# ğŸ‘€ constants

This is recommended at the top of most Pages and Page Templates if you are using Siteglide-CLI. It is not needed on the Siteglide Admin because it's included but hidden.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/siteglide_system/constants' -%}
{% endraw %}


```

{% content-ref url="../../cms/pages/about-pages/pages-with-siteglide-cli.md" %}
[pages-with-siteglide-cli.md](../../cms/pages/about-pages/pages-with-siteglide-cli.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
