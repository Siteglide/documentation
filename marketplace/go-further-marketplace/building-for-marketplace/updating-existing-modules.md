# Updating Existing Modules


Here I will outline key tips and information in maintaing your existing module once it has been created.

## Maintaining Your Git Repo

When anyone (yourself or someone else) installs your module, it will automatically take a copy of anything currently within the master branch of your Git Repo.&#x20;

If you would like to work on updates or new additions to your module, it is strongly recommended that you create a new branch in your repository so that it does not impact what is installed until your are ready.&#x20;

Create a new branch and call `staging` for example. From now on, send your initial commits to staging while you are testing. When you are ready to release an update to your module, merge into the `master` branch in Git.

## Notifiying Users Of An Update

Once you have committed a new version to your `master` branch in Git, edit your module in Siteglide Portal to update the version number and let people know there is a new version available to install.
