# Order

In the first tab you will find the following settings related to Orders:

## Order Slug

This slug helps define the URL for reaching Order Detail pages . It comes after your domain. The default is “siteglide-orders” so that it doesn’t conflict with any page you have already set up, but we recommend you change it to something like "orders".

## Order Detail Page Template

In order to dynamically create a Detail Page for each of your Orders, you need to set a Page Template.
