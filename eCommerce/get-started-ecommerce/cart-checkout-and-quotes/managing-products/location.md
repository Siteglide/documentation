# How do I add a location to Products?

Whilst editing a Product, navigate to the "Location" tab.

Here you can manage and edit the address and longitude/latitude fields.

Using one of the two methods:

- Search for an Address - Search for an address that you'd like to use, and select from the results in the dropdown

Or

- Address - Manually enter the address in text form, and

- Longitude/Latitude - GeoJSON - enter the address as coordinates [long, lat]

Once you have done this, click save; and head over to our Location docs to set this up.
