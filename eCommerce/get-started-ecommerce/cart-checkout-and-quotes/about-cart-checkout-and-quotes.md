# ðŸ’¡ About Cart, Checkout and Quotes

## When to Use?

The Cart and Checkout flow is most likely right for you if your site:

* Will sell a selection of products
  * Physical or Digital
  * Where the user can select one or many to purchase at once
  * Optionally charge for shipping
  * Optionally offer discounts
    * Bulk Discounts
    * Discount Codes
  * Include tax in prices
* Will eventually want to sell the products, but as an extra step will want to send an official quote to the customer for their selection of products.
