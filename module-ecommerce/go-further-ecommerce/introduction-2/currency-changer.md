## What it does


Our Currency Changer will allow you to output a list of all currencies on your site, and then set a new currency for that session.

The JS function must be sent a valid currency code in lowercase. See the layout named `default` for an example of how this is achieved via a `<select />` dropdown.

When changing currency, then default Tax Code for that currency is also automatically applied.

## How to add the Currency Changer to your view


You can add a Currency Changer to your site using the following include:

`{%- include 'ecommerce/currency_changer', layout: 'default' -%}`

***

## Layouts


You can find layouts at `layouts > modules > module_14 (eCommerce) > components > currency_changer > your_layout_name_here`

The layout will require a `wrapper` and `item` file, which you can see in place in the layout named `default` that comes installed with the eCommerce Module.
